  "additionalContext": "Pain Points\n1. Product data inconsistency — SKU names, attributes, and descriptions differ across Shopify, Amazon, and Sephora.\n2. Manual onboarding for new SKUs — Each product must be formatted and uploaded per channel.\n3. Frequent listing errors — Missing images or mismatched variants lead to listing rejections.\n4. Disconnected PIM workflows — Salsify updates don't propagate to all systems.\n5. Time-consuming updates — Marketing and operations teams manually reconcile product data across systems.\n\nIntegration Goals\n• Enable bidirectional sync between Salsify, Shopify, Amazon, and NetSuite.\n• Centralize product data and digital assets under Salsify and Bynder as the golden record.\n• Replace manual CSV uploads with automated, event-driven updates.\n• Provide real-time SKU-level visibility and analytics in BigQuery.\n• Improve product data governance and consistency across all sales channels.",
